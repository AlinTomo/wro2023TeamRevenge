Shell:
The shell of the robot is meticulously crafted by hand, utilizing a sturdy wooden base as its foundation, complemented by meticulously assembled LEGO Technic pieces. The construction of the shell involves a careful process, ensuring precise alignment and structural integrity. The design of the shell incorporates an elevated height, strategically planned to create ample space beneath it to accommodate various essential components.

Steering:
The steering mechanism employed in the robot is ingeniously engineered using a combination of LEGO pieces and a rudimentary yet effective system of interconnected rods and linkages. This clever configuration grants the robot the ability to articulate its front wheels with an impressive range of rotation, enabling it to navigate corners and tight spaces with remarkable agility. The steering mechanism is expertly actuated by a powerful and versatile 180-degree servo motor, which imparts precise control over the turning motion.

Motor:
Powering the robot's traction is a simple yet reliable DC motor that has been repurposed from a toy car. This motor serves as the driving force behind the robot's movement, propelling it forward with determination. To efficiently control the motor, a dedicated motor driver board, known as the "L298N Motor Drive Controller Board," is employed. This sophisticated board facilitates the regulation of both the motor's direction and speed, thanks to its integration of a pulse-width modulation (PWM) input signal.

Traction:
Efficiently transferring the motor's power to the wheels is accomplished through a thoughtfully designed differential mechanism. The rear wheels of the robot are ingeniously connected to the motor via this differential assembly. The primary function of the differential is to distribute power evenly between the two drive wheels, ensuring a balanced and coordinated movement. This intelligent design allows the wheels to rotate at varying speeds whenever the situation demands it. Notably, during turns, the differential grants the outer wheel the ability to travel a greater distance than the inner wheel, enabling smooth and precise maneuvering. This differential mechanism is meticulously engineered, incorporating a precisely calibrated arrangement of gears and shafts that permit the wheels to rotate at different speeds without hindering the overall rotation of the robot.

Electronics:
The electronic system of the robot comprises a carefully organized architecture, divided into two distinct circuits, each serving a specific purpose. These circuits are powered by a reliable 12V LiPo battery and are independently activated through separate switches. The first circuit is responsible for providing power to the motor driver board, which subsequently controls the traction motor. The second circuit serves as the central hub for all the controllers and sensors integrated into the robot. To ensure compatibility and optimal functionality of the various electronic components, a DC-DC converter is employed to efficiently convert the 12V battery voltage to a stable 5V output. This regulated voltage is utilized to power the diverse range of components constituting the electronic system. Furthermore, the distribution of electrical current within the robot is meticulously managed through a meticulously hand-soldered stripboard, meticulously designed to deliver reliable and precise power supply.

Sensors:
The robot is equipped with a comprehensive array of sensors, providing it with valuable data for perceiving and interacting with its environment. Notably, ultrasonic sensors play a crucial role in the robot's perception capabilities. Three high-performance ultrasonic sensors, commonly known as "HC-SR04," are strategically positioned on the robot. Two of these sensors are placed laterally on either side, while one is positioned at the front. The HC-SR04 sensors utilize ultrasonic waves to measure the distance between the robot and nearby objects. By precisely calculating the time of flight of the emitted sound waves and analyzing the resulting data, the sensors are capable of accurately determining the distance from obstacles or walls, enabling the robot to navigate its surroundings with confidence and precision.

Reset Button:
To initiate the robot's operation or provide a reset function, a conveniently located  reset button is incorporated into the robot's design. This button serves as a user interface element, allowing for the initiation of specific actions or resetting the robot's state when pressed. To detect the button press and trigger the corresponding actions, an interrupt is implemented on the Arduino microcontroller, which effectively changes the robot's state and initiates the desired operation.

Camera:
To enhance the robot's perception and obstacle avoidance capabilities, a sophisticated camera system is integrated into its framework. Specifically, a high-quality camera, the "Raspberry Pi Camera 2," is utilized in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi board. This camera is strategically connected to the Raspberry Pi, providing it with a live feed of the robot's surroundings. By leveraging image processing algorithms and techniques, the Raspberry Pi analyzes the captured images in real-time, enabling it to detect and identify obstacles or objects of interest. The camera system plays a vital role in the robot's decision-making process, providing valuable visual information that aids in navigation and obstacle avoidance.

Controllers:
The robot's control system relies on the seamless interaction between two distinct controllers: an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi 4. Each controller serves a specific set of functions, contributing to the overall operation and intelligence of the robot. The Arduino Uno is primarily responsible for sensor data acquisition, excluding the camera, and driving the robot's motors based on the received inputs. The Arduino program is structured into two states: State 0, which awaits the start signal, and State 1, triggered by the reset button press, transitioning the robot into its driving mode. Initially, the robot positions itself at the center point between two walls, anticipating the first curve. As soon as an extended distance is detected by one of the sensors, the robot swiftly steers in the corresponding direction, thereafter maintaining close proximity to the central wall to effectively navigate subsequent curves. By accurately counting the number of curves encountered, the robot intelligently calculates the number of laps completed and determines the optimal stopping point.

Whenever the Raspberry Pi detects an obstacle through its camera system, it promptly sends a signal to the Arduino, notifying it of the impending obstruction. Based on the color of the detected object, the Raspberry Pi employs a hue-saturation-value (HSV) filter to isolate and generate a binary image, containing only the objects of interest. The Raspberry Pi then proceeds to identify the rectangular bounding box surrounding the object, calculates its area, and determines if the object is in close proximity based on its size. Finally, a signal corresponding to the color of the detected object is sent to the Arduino via a GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) bus, enabling the robot to make appropriate evasive maneuvers. The utilization of a GPIO bus ensures minimal latency in the communication between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, facilitating swift and responsive decision-making.
